# Web scraping With Python
Python code for <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26284925/">《Web scraping with Python》</a> with my annotation and warnings. I hope I can insist on going through the whole book to improve my skills both in python and web scraping. Luckily, this book is not so swallen with only 220 pages while I 've already finished almost a quarter of them. And I plan to finish it in half a month.
