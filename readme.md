# Python爬虫开发与项目实践

1.Intro
---

This is the code for <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/27061630/">《Python爬虫开发与项目实践》</a>。I'll cover most of the code mentioned in the book. For the convinence of writing code, there are some codes written in one file. So if you want to run the file, maybe you need to anotate some code. Of course, you just need to have a glance at my anotations then `#` some blocks of code. All of codes run successfully with Python3 on MacOS.   
Also, I provided some small program for python scraping like download pictures or download some novels. You can have fun with it.
