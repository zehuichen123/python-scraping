# Web scraping With Python
This is the code in the book when I study 《Web scraping with Python》 with some my annotation and warnings. I hope I can insist on going through the whole book to improve my skills both in python and web scraping. Luckily, this book is not so swallen with only 220 pages while I 've already finished almost a quarter of them. And I plan to finish it in half a month.  
If you find some mistakes please open an issue or just email me. Thanx!
